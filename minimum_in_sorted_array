Problem Statement: Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). 
Now the array is rotated between 1 to N times which is unknown. Find the minimum element in the array. 
Example 1:
Input Format: arr = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3]
Result: 0
Explanation: Here, the element 0 is the minimum element in the array.

int findMin(vector<int>& arr)
{
	// Write your code here.
	int n=arr.size();
	int low=0;
	int high=n-1;
	int ans=INT_MAX;

	while(low<=high)
	{
		int mid=(low+high)/2;
		if(arr[low]<=arr[mid])
		{
			ans=min(ans,arr[low]);
			low=mid+1;
		}
		else
		{
			ans=min(ans,arr[mid]);
			high=mid-1;
		}
	}
	return ans;
}
