Problem Statement: You are given a sorted array containing N integers and a number X, you have to find the occurrences of X 
in the given array.
Example 1:
Input: N = 7,  X = 3 , array[] = {2, 2 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 4}
Output: 4
Explanation: 3 is occurring 4 times in 
the given array so it is our answer.



int count(vector<int>& arr, int n, int x) {
	// Write Your Code Here
	int cnt=0;
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
	{
		if(arr[i]==x)
		{
			cnt++;
		}
	}
	return cnt;
}
