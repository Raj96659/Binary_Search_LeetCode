Problem statement
You are given an integer array 'A' of size 'N', sorted in non-decreasing order. You are also given an integer 'target'.
Your task is to write a function to search for 'target' in the array 'A'. If it exists, return its index in 0-based indexing.
If 'target' is not present in the array 'A', return -1.

Example:

Input: ‘N’ = 7 ‘target’ = 3
‘A’ = [1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 12, 45]

Output: 1

int search(vector<int> &nums, int target) {
    // Write your code here.
    int n = nums.size();
    int low=0;
    int high=n-1;
    
    while(low<=high)
    {
        int mid=(low+high)/2;
        if(nums[mid]==target) return mid;
        else if(target>nums[mid]) low=mid+1;
        else  high=mid-1;
    }
    return -1;
}
